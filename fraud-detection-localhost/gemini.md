# Project Summary: End-to-End Fraud Detection System

This is a comprehensive and well-structured project for a credit card fraud detection system.

Here's a summary of its key components:

*   **Technology Stack**: The project is built primarily in Python, using a microservices architecture orchestrated with Docker and Docker Compose. It includes services for a FastAPI-based API, a Streamlit dashboard, and likely a Jupyter environment for experimentation.
*   **Machine Learning Core**:
    *   An XGBoost model is used for fraud detection, with model artifacts like the trained model and feature names stored in the `/models` directory.
    *   The project follows a standard MLOps workflow, including notebooks for exploration and feature engineering, scripts for training, and a structured `/src` directory for production code.
*   **API & Dashboard**:
    *   A FastAPI application (`/src/api`, `/ml-service`) serves predictions and other endpoints.
    *   A Streamlit dashboard (`/dashboard`) provides a user interface for data overview, model performance, real-time predictions, and monitoring.
*   **Data Management**: Data is systematically organized into `raw`, `processed`, and `features` directories, which is a best practice for managing ML data pipelines.
*   **Monitoring & Testing**: The inclusion of Prometheus and Grafana configurations (`/monitoring`) and a dedicated `/tests` directory indicates a focus on production-readiness, with capabilities for monitoring and automated testing.

### Future Project Idea: Real-Time Graph-Based Fraud Analytics

A powerful next step for this project would be to evolve it from a transaction-based detection system to a **real-time, graph-based fraud analytics platform**.

While the current model likely assesses individual transactions, sophisticated fraud often involves networks of colluding entities (e.g., users, merchants, devices). A graph-based approach can uncover these complex patterns.

**Key Features**:

1.  **Graph Database Integration**: Integrate a graph database like Neo4j or TigerGraph. Transactions, users, merchants, and devices would be modeled as nodes, and their interactions as edges.
2.  **Graph Feature Engineering**: Develop features based on network structure, such as:
    *   **Centrality Measures**: Identify unusually influential or connected entities.
    *   **Community Detection**: Find clusters of fraudulent accounts that operate together.
    *   **Shortest Path Analysis**: Detect money laundering paths or abnormally long transaction chains.
3.  **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Models**: Implement a GNN (e.g., using PyTorch Geometric or DGL) to learn from the graph structure directly. This can capture much more complex relationships than the current XGBoost model.
4.  **Enhanced Real-Time Processing**: Augment the `steam_processor` (assuming `stream_processor` was intended) to update the graph in real-time as new transactions occur, allowing for immediate detection of emerging fraudulent networks.
5.  **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Add a new page to the Streamlit dashboard to visualize the transaction graph, allowing analysts to explore connections and investigate fraud rings interactively.

This evolution would significantly enhance the system's ability to detect and prevent complex, coordinated fraud, moving it closer to a state-of-the-art financial security platform.
